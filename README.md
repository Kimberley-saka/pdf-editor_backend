# pdf-editor_backend
  * This is an API for a pdf editor application

## Motivation
One time I had a PDF I wanted to edit but converting it to a Word document made it lose its initial formatting and I didn't want to go through the hustle of reformatting. I scoured the internet for pdf editors and most that claimed to be "free" all put a watermark on my document which I did not want. So I decided to create my own tool.
